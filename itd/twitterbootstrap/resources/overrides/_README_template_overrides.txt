#Put jbot-style overrides in this folder. 
For example, if you want to override a template,
put a file with the full path to that object in here.

I wanted to override a template in collective.portletpage.
So, I copied that template into this dir, and made the filename:

  collective.portletpage.browser.portletpage-column.pt
