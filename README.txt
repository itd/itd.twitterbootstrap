Introduction
============
Another Plone theme based on Twitter Bootstrap.
Mostly tested with with Plone 4.2rc2.

Handles showing and hiding columns in a weird way.
I think it'll work alright.

Your mileage may vary.


Other goodies
------------------

FitText
~~~~~~~~
I think it needed more flexible type options. So, I added
"jquery.fittext.js" to see how well it plays out.

Shoot me. I'm a code tourist.
