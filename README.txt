Introduction
============
Another Plone theme based on Twitter Bootstrap.
Mostly tested with with Plone 4.2rc2.

Abuses Diazo goodness.

Handles showing and hiding columns in a weird way.
I think it'll work alright.

Your mileage may vary.


Opinions
---------------
Yeah, we all have them. If tell me something sucks here,
maybe I'll fix it.


CSS and JS
-------------
I ripped the CSS and JS straight from the latest
twitter boostrap example assets. Then, I applied
silly overrides as I felt I needed to. Granted, my
methods may not be the cleanest. You'll find my overrides
in the './resources/' folder in these files:
  local-static.css
  local.js

Tweak away. remove the content, do whatever. :-)
It's all yours!


Template overrides
---------------------
I added overrides for 'logo.pt' and 'footer.pt' inside
'./resources/overrides/'
Look in that folder for a little doc-age.


Other goodies
------------------

FitText
~~~~~~~~
I think it needed more flexible type options. So, I added
"jquery.fittext.js" to see how well it plays out.

Shoot me. I'm a code tourist.
