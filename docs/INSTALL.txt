itd.twitterbootstrap Installation
---------------------------------------

To install itd.twitterbootstrap:

* Add ``itd.twitterbootstrap`` to the list of eggs to install:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        itd.twitterbootstrap


* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        itd.twitterbootstrap


* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout


You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
